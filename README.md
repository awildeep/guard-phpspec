Simple custom guard example using the guard-shell to run phpspec tests.

I found [https://github.com/lsd/guard-phpspec] but it does not appear to be updated or maintained.

This is just to get me up and running with guard for now, and *may* become something more in the future.


You may need to modify this to get it to work for your project, for example if your phpspec executable is not in ./bin/.
